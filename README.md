# Python Seaborn Library for Data Visualization

Seaborn is a Python data visualization library built on top of the matplotlib library. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics. It is specifically designed to interact with Pandas DataFrames to create statistical plots by providing various functions to draw plots, and all the customization is done through function arguments.

We will learn how to create various types of plots using the python seaborn library with various examples and use cases. We will analyze the results to learn how to analyze the plots and make reports or observations. At the same time, we will also learn and understand the theory of when to use which types of plots. This will help us in the selection of correct plots to make correct decisions.

Scatter Plots
Distribution Plots
Categorical Plots
Comparison Plots
Seaborn Girds
Matrix Plots
